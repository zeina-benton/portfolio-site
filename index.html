      The Europa Clipper Mapping Imaging Spectrometer for Europa (MISE) and the Europa Imaging System (EIS) will provide high-resolution optical remote sensing of Europa’s surface, capturing data across a broad spectral range from the near-ultraviolet to the infrared. EIS will deliver high spatial resolution multispectral and panchromatic imagery, while MISE will collect lower spatial resolution but spectrally detailed data. Together, these instruments will allow researchers to assess both the composition and texture of Europa’s surface by analyzing spatial and spectral variability. Accurate interpretation of these observations requires a deep understanding of how sunlight interacts with the moon's surface materials and how those materials reflect light at different wavelengths. The ICONS intern will contribute to this research by supporting efforts at APL, potentially including the implementation and validation of theoretical reflectance models, analysis of legacy remote sensing data from past missions, laboratory-based spectral measurements of analog materials, and preliminary interpretation of Europa Clipper data to better understand the moon's surface properties.</p>

      NGC 2264, an open star-forming region in the Monoceros constellation, features two well-known concentrated stellar regions in the North and South. Made of gas and dust, these stellar regions are sites of interest for their ongoing star formation. This research aims to investigate the membership of NGC 2264 with a focus on the northern and southern star-forming regions. Using Gaia DR3, a spacecraft that monitors celestial movements, properties such as parallax and photometry can be used to determine what stars belong in the membership of NGC 2264. Parallax, the apparent shift in an object's position due to the observer's perspective, measures optically visible stars observed by Gaia. Additionally, 2MASS, an astronomical survey, provides near-infrared data that will be used in this study. By cross-matching 2MASS and Gaia data, a distance and spatial distribution of sources within the star-forming regions reveal how the stars are dispersed, defining the structure, size, and membership of these regions in NGC 2264. Determining stellar membership is important for understanding the structure and stellar formation of NGC 2264.</p>

      Feminine aesthetics, beauty standards, and racialized sexuality converge in the global nail and manicure industry, where gender, race, and labor histories intersect in complex ways. Originating in the Renaissance and evolving through various cultural contexts—including elite societies in Egypt, China, and Latin America, nail art has long been a symbol of status and expression. In the 20th century, the U.S. nail industry became a crucial space for Vietnamese and Korean immigrant women seeking economic opportunity, while Black women shaped trends such as long acrylic nails under the influence of hip-hop culture. These innovations were later appropriated and stigmatized by dominant white, upper-class beauty norms, reinforcing stereotypes around professionalism and sexuality. Media like Adele Pham’s Nailed It (2018) document the industry's immigrant roots and the labor inequalities faced by Vietnamese salon workers, while also celebrating the resilience and creativity of marginalized communities. Nail culture thus operates as both a contested and empowering space, revealing broader systems of racial, gendered, and class-based power.</p>

      Acrylic nails are a powerful form of cultural expression among Black women and femmes, representing beauty, creativity, identity, and resistance. More than just a style, they mark moments of transition, hold personal and communal memory, and serve as a language of care and connection. This project looks at how acrylic nails shape and reflect gendered identity, create bonds within community spaces, and preserve stories that often go undocumented. Through a mixed-methods approach—an anonymous survey, personal interviews, and a visual archiving project featuring submissions from Black nail artists and enthusiasts—the work centers the lived experiences and artistry of those who have made nails a canvas for survival, pride, and self-definition. The final outcomes will include a coffee table book, academic writing, and a public art exhibit in Richmond, all rooted in honoring the cultural legacy and embodied narratives held within Black femme nail culture.</p>
